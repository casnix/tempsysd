In `RunInternals.pm`, make device and service functions hashed maps to private
methods.  %service and %device.

The functions in Tempsysdctl that use disk (all|raid) temperatures should
have a modular function call.  The web service and CLI service should use the same
function to get temperatures.  I.e: (getAllDisks|getRaidDisks)paths->tempCall->format.
