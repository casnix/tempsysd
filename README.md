# tempsysd
A daemon for monitoring disk and CPU temperature on a NAS, and updating information for a web server.

Update 09/10/2020
The full working perl scripts were hosted on a RAID10 array that has failed.  I have not rebuilt this array to recover the data, so what you see in this repository is incomplete.  The libraries I wrote in this are not incomplete however.
